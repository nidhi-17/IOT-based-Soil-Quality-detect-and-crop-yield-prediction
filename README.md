The system consists of two main users: the farmer and the retailer. The farmer can
test the soil through the IoT kit and view the soil parameters and the weather conditions
(fetched from OpenWeatherMap API) and recommendations given by the machine
learning models through the web application. The retailer can use the web application
to find farmers based on their requirements such as location, crop cultivation, and soil
quality. Once they find a suitable match, they can directly connect to them to buy
crops.
